# Influence of reduced numerical precision in SNN hardware implementation

This repo accompanies the article of the same name. The article's DOI will be indicated as soon as it is available.
The results folder includes the original data and figures from the article. The jupyter notebooks are available to construct the networks discussed in the paper and evaluate their performance. The python scripts have the same content as the notebooks but show fewer intermediate results and allow repeated analysis. They are ready to generate additional results to those discussed in the article, be careful as the results in the results folder will be overwritten.
